# Artificial_Intelligence-

**About** <br />
This was the 3rd project completed in my CS380 Artifical Intelligence course. 

**Project** <br />
The goal of this project was to implement a command line game of Connect3. Then implement a random & minmax algorithm to play against as an AI. <br />

**Inputs** <br />
sh runVS.sh 'command'<br />
<br />
commands:<br />
<br />
random - play against a CPU that is playing randomly.<br />
minimax - play against a CPU that is using a minmax algorithm. <br />
<br />
**Output** <br />
Current Board state, requires input of 1-4 according to row number. Loops until tie or someone wins then diplays every move during course of game.
